step 1->  turn all the node white which was connected to the died dominator node except 
dominant nodes that are connected to at least two other nodes in which at least one black node.
.
	//this step ensures that there is at least one white node in the resulting graph

step 2-> pick one white node among them which is connected to most no of node with priority
      (1. black    2.grey    3.white)

step 3-> Search the nearest black node using breadth first search.

step 4-> turn all the nodes white that come in the path of that white node and nearest black node.

step 5-> apply guha and khuller algorithm from that black node.

step 6-> repeat step 2 untill there remains any one white node.
